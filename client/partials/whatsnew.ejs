    <h2>What's New in v0.3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No more Fast Track for the time being. <b>Fast Track patients should be assigned to APP</b> - even if they are not up for rotation. You can assign them a patient using the            <button class="secondary outline">
        <%- include('./icons/walkin.svg'); %>
      </button> button.</li>
      <li>
        The <b>APP</b> flag highlights which attending is next to staff with APP. After staffing, click <b>APP</b> to advance the flag to the next doctor. Buttons at the bottom of rotation can move the APP flag as needed.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What's New v0.2</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Assigning patients now requires you to select a
        <b>Patient Type</b>. The "bonus" type is for use if a clinician
        picks up a patient when it is not their turn.
      </li>
      <li>
        <button class="secondary outline">
          <%- include('./icons/walkin.svg'); %>
        </button>
        This button can be used to assign patients to clinicians when it
        is not their turn. Using this button to assign patients does not
        affect the rotation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <button class="secondary outline">
          <%- include('./icons/reassign.svg') %>
        </button>
        This button shows up in the Timeline section for patient
        assignments. It allows you to reassign a previously assigned
        patient to another clinician without changing the rotation.<br /><br />For
        example, if one doctor is in with a critical patient and another
        doctor wants to pick up their patient without changing the
        rotation, you can use this button to reassign that patient.
