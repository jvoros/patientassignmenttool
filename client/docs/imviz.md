# Viz.AI

Our usage of Viz.AI is to allow various team members to easily communicate about patient care. It is built around imaging studies.

For now, all Trauma and Stroke patients will have their images pushed to Viz. But the radiology techs can push *any study* to Viz. So if you'd like to make it easy for your ortho colleagues to see an x-ray, you could ask to have it pushed to Viz.

### Log In
Download the Viz AI app for your smartphone. If you don't know your password, open the app and click "Forgot Password". You should then be emailed a link to set a password.

### Using Viz

Once you log in you will see lists of patients.

The ðŸ’¬ speech bubble icon lets you see the text thread communications about the patient. 

The three-dots button brings up a context menu that lets you alert various services. For example, if you click the orange scalpel button for "Trauma Surgery" you can send an alert to everyone logged in for that service. This is a loud "AMBER Alert" type alarm on their end.

Viz can then be used for ongoing communication about the patient.
