# Patient Assignment Tool

A web application used by emergency department staff to assign patients to doctors and advance-practice providers (APPs) during a shift. It tracks who is up next in a rotation, records patient arrivals, and keeps a live event log of board activity.

There is no connection to any medical record system. No patient-identifying data is stored — only room number, arrival mode, and arrival time.

---

## What it does

The application is built around a **board**. Each emergency department (site) has one board per calendar day. The board tracks:

- Which providers are on shift and which zone they are working
- Who is next in each rotation to receive a patient
- A running log of events (assignments, sign-ins, sign-outs, etc.)
- The ability to undo the most recent action

When the first shift of a new day signs in, the board resets and the previous day's data is cleared. If the site config has been updated since the previous day, the new config is picked up automatically on reset.

## Core module (`server/core`)

This is the heart of the application. It is pure TypeScript with no framework dependencies — no Nuxt, no database, no Vue. Every function takes a `Board` and returns a new `Board`.

### The `withUndo` pattern

Every action is wrapped with `withUndo`, which:
1. Clones the board with `structuredClone` before mutation
2. Applies the mutation
3. Returns both `{ board, oldboard }`

The `oldboard` is passed to `addUndo` in the database layer so it can be restored if the user undoes the action.

### The `Core` public API

Server routes interact with `Core` exclusively through `dispatch`. It exposes:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Core.build` | Creates a fresh empty board from a site config |
| `Core.signIn` | Adds a provider/schedule as a new shift; resets the board if the schedule's `reset` flag is set, picking up any config changes |
| `Core.signOut` | Moves a shift to the Off Rotation zone |
| `Core.joinZone` | Adds a shift to an additional zone |
| `Core.leaveZone` | Removes a shift from a zone |
| `Core.switchZone` | Moves a shift from one zone to another |
| `Core.deleteShift` | Removes a shift with zero patients from the board |
| `Core.adjustRotation` | Manually advances or steps back a rotation pointer |
| `Core.togglePause` | Pauses or unpauses a shift in the rotation |
| `Core.addTriage` | Increments the triage count on a shift |
| `Core.assignToShift` | Assigns a patient directly to a named shift |
| `Core.assignToZone` | Assigns a patient to whoever is next in a zone's rotation |
| `Core.reassign` | Moves a patient from one shift to another, adjusting supervisor counts |
| `Core.changeRoom` | Updates the room on an existing assignment event |
| `Core.updateNote` | Updates the note on an existing event |

### Zones

Each board has several zones. A zone's `type` determines its behaviour:

| Type | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `dual` | Rotates both patient assignments and supervisor assignments from the same list |
| `rotation` | Rotates patient assignments only |
| `simple` | The shift at index 0 is always next; used for fast-track / pit zones |
| `list` | No rotation; used for the Off Rotation zone |

### Board reset and config updates

`Core.reset()` is called automatically when the first shift of a new day signs in (when `schedule.reset === true`). If a `siteConfig` is provided, the board is rebuilt from the fresh config — picking up any zone, schedule, or provider changes made via the admin panel. Without a config, it rebuilds from the existing board's zone definitions.

### Board state

The board is a single JSON object. Key fields:

```ts
type Board = {
  slug: string;            // site identifier
  date: number;            // timestamp for the board day
  zoneOrder: string[];     // display order of zones
  timeline: string[];      // ordered list of recent event IDs
  zones: IndexZone;        // zone state keyed by slug
  shifts: IndexShift;      // shift state keyed by id
  events: IndexBoardEvent; // event log keyed by id
}
```

---

## Authentication and sessions

Sites are protected by a shared access code — one code per emergency department, known by all staff on shift. There are no per-user accounts.

### Login flow

1. User submits site slug and access code to `POST /api/auth/login`
2. Server fetches the stored hash and salt for that site via `getAccessCode(slug)`
3. The submitted code is verified with `verifyCode(submitted, hash, salt)`
4. On success, `setUserSession({ user: { slug } })` stores the site slug in an encrypted cookie
5. Client refreshes its session and navigates to `/board`

Session cookies are encrypted using `NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD` via `nuxt-auth-utils`. The plaintext access code is never stored.

### Route protection

`app/middleware/auth.global.ts` runs on every route change:
- `/` redirects to `/board` if logged in, `/login` if not
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
- Authenticated users visiting `/login` are redirected to `/board`

### Admin authentication

The admin panel (`/admin`) requires a second layer of authentication on top of the regular site session. A separate `NUXT_ADMIN_CODE` environment variable is the admin password — it is not stored in the database.

**Admin login flow:**

1. Any route using the `admin` middleware is intercepted by `app/middleware/admin.ts`
2. If `session.admin` is not `true`, the user is redirected to `/admin-lock` with the intended path as a `redirect` query param
3. The user submits the admin code on `/admin-lock`, which posts to `POST /api/auth/verify-admin`
4. The server compares the submitted code to `NUXT_ADMIN_CODE` directly — no hashing needed since it never touches the database
5. On success, the existing session is updated in place with `admin: true` and the user is redirected back to their intended page

This keeps the admin gate lightweight — no separate admin accounts, no database changes, just a flag added to the existing session cookie.

### Admin panel (`/admin`)

`admin.vue` provides a full JSON editor (via `json-editor-vue`) for the site config. Changes are saved via `useBoard().updateConfig()` which posts to `POST /api/config/[slug]`. A warning badge appears when there are unsaved changes and the save button is disabled if the JSON is invalid.

Config changes take effect on the next daily board reset — when the first shift signs in the following morning, `Core.reset()` rebuilds the board from the updated config.

### Access codes

Access codes are stored as **HMAC-SHA256 hashes with a per-site random salt**. To set a code for a site:

**Step 1** — Generate a salt and hash in Node:

```sh
node -e "import('node:crypto').then(({randomBytes,createHmac})=>{
  const salt=randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
  const hash=createHmac('sha256',salt).update('your-code').digest('hex');
  console.log('salt:',salt);
  console.log('hash:',hash);
})"
```

**Step 2** — Paste the output into a Turso SQL statement:

```sql
UPDATE sites
SET access_code_hash = '<hash>', access_code_salt = '<salt>'
WHERE slug = 'smh';
```

## Real-time updates (WebSockets)

Board state is kept in sync across all connected users via WebSockets. Nitro's built-in pub/sub handles broadcasting.

### Server

Each site has its own WebSocket endpoint at `/ws/[slug]` (`server/routes/ws/[slug].ts`). On connection:

1. The `upgrade` hook reads the session cookie and rejects with 401 if the session slug doesn't match the URL slug
2. On `open`, the peer subscribes to the site's pub/sub topic
3. On `message`, the action is passed to `dispatch` which runs it through `Core`, persists the result, and returns the updated board
4. The updated board is broadcast to all connected users at that site, including the sender
5. On `close`, the peer unsubscribes

All board mutations go through the WebSocket. The client sends:

```json
{ "action": "assignToZone", "payload": { "zoneSlug": "main", "mode": "walkin", "room": "4" } }
```

The server responds to all connected clients with:

```json
{ "ok": true, "board": { ... } }
```

Errors are returned only to the sender:

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": "Cannot leave last zone with shift" }
```

Undo is also handled via the WebSocket — send `{ "action": "undo" }` with no payload.

The server also responds to `{ "action": "ping" }` with `{ "action": "pong" }` — used by the client keepalive loop.

### `dispatch` (`server/utils/dispatch.ts`)

Sits between the WebSocket handler and `Core`. For every action it:
1. Fetches the current board and site config from the database
2. Calls `Core[action](board, payload)` — for `signIn`, also passes `siteConfig` so resets pick up config changes
3. Saves the pre-action board to `undos` and writes the updated board via `updateBoard`
4. Calls `clearUndos` if the action triggered a daily reset (`result.reset === true`)

---

## Client composables

### `useAuth` (`app/composables/useAuth.ts`)

Centralises all authentication logic. Wraps `nuxt-auth-utils` so pages never call `$fetch` or `useUserSession` directly.

```ts
const { loggedIn, session, login, logout } = useAuth();
```

| Return value | Description |
|---|---|
| `loggedIn` | Reactive boolean — true if a valid session cookie exists |
| `session` | Reactive session object — contains `user.slug` |
| `login(slug, code)` | Posts credentials, refreshes session, navigates to `/board` |
| `logout()` | Clears session, navigates to `/login` |

### `createSocket` (`app/composables/useSocket.ts`)

Low-level WebSocket connection factory. Not called directly by components — used internally by `useBoard`.

```ts
const socket = createSocket(slug, boardHandler);
```

Handles all connection infrastructure:

- **Keepalive ping** — sends `{ action: "ping" }` every 25 seconds to prevent DigitalOcean's load balancer from dropping the idle connection (60s timeout)
- **Automatic reconnect** — on unexpected close, retries with exponential backoff starting at 1s, capped at 30s
- **Message routing** — ignores pong responses, calls `boardHandler` only when the message contains a `board` key
- **Cleanup** — on `beforeunload`, marks the connection as intentionally closed to suppress reconnect attempts, then closes the socket

```ts
socket.send(data)      // sends JSON to the server
socket.connected       // reactive ref<boolean> — true when the socket is open
```

### `useBoard` (`app/composables/useBoard.ts`)

Centralises all board state and communication. Any page or component that needs board state or wants to dispatch an action calls `useBoard()`.

```ts
const { board, config, connected, send } = useBoard();
```

| Return value | Description |
|---|---|
| `board` | Reactive `Board \| null` — updated on every server broadcast |
| `config` | Reactive `SiteConfig \| null` — populated on initial fetch |
| `connected` | Reactive boolean — WebSocket connection status |
| `send(action)` | Sends a board action, returns a `Promise` that resolves when the next board broadcast arrives |
| `initializeBoard()` | Fetches the initial board state and opens the WebSocket — call once on the board page |
| `updateConfig(slug, config)` | Posts a config update and refreshes board state |
| `getShiftName(id)` | Returns `"First Last"` for a shift id |
| `getShiftsAlphabetically()` | Returns shift ids sorted by provider last name |

**State** — `board`, `config`, and `socket` are module-level variables shared across all `useBoard()` calls. SSR is disabled so plain `ref`s are used instead of `useState`.

**Initialization** — `initializeBoard()` is called once in `board.vue`. It fetches the initial board via HTTP then opens the WebSocket via `createSocket`. Subsequent `useBoard()` calls from child components share the same state and socket automatically.

**The send/resolve cycle** — `send()` stores the Promise's `resolve`/`reject` in `pendingSend`, then sends the action over the socket. When the server broadcasts the updated board back, `boardHandler` writes the new board to state and calls `pendingSend.resolve()`, settling the Promise. If another client's broadcast arrives first, the Promise settles early — which is fine since the board is already at the latest state.

```ts
// In board.vue — initialize once
const { board, initializeBoard } = useBoard();
initializeBoard();

// In any component — just call useBoard()
const { send } = useBoard();
await send({ action: "assignToZone", payload: { zoneSlug: "main", mode: "walkin", room: "4" } });
```

## Client utilities (`app/utils`)

### `shiftFlags.ts`

Derives per-shift display flags from a shift and its zone context. Used by `SectionRotation.vue` to compute flags once per shift and pass them down to `Shift.vue` as a single prop.

```ts
const flags = getShiftFlags(shiftId, zone, shift);
// { isNext, isSuper, isRotating, isPaused, isSkipped, isOff }
```

`isPaused` and `isSkipped` only evaluate to `true` for `rotation` and `dual` zone types.

### `dates.ts`

Date formatting helpers for displaying event timestamps in the timeline.

### `modes.ts`

Helpers for patient arrival mode labels and icons (`walkin`, `ambo`, `police`, `ft`, `heli`).

---

## Database layer (`server/db`)

Connects to a Turso-hosted SQLite database. The schema has three tables:

### `sites`
One row per emergency department. Stores the site config JSON, the current active board JSON, and the hashed access code — all on the same row.

```
slug             TEXT PRIMARY KEY
site             TEXT  -- JSON: full SiteConfig (zones, schedule, providers, rooms)
board            TEXT  -- JSON: current Board state (null until first sign-in)
access_code_hash TEXT  -- HMAC-SHA256 hash of the site access code
access_code_salt TEXT  -- per-site random salt
```

### `undos`
One row per saved prior board state. Each action saves the pre-action board here before applying the mutation. The `undo` field on the board JSON holds the row ID to restore. Rows older than 48 hours are pruned on each daily reset, giving a recovery window for accidental resets.

```
id    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
board TEXT  -- JSON: Board state before the action
site  TEXT
date  INTEGER
```

### `logs`
Running shift activity totals, rewritten on every board save via `updateBoard`. Used for end-of-day reporting. Because logs are written atomically with every board update, they are always current — including after an undo.

```
date, site, shift, provider  -- composite primary key
assigned, supervised, bounty -- bounty = triaged count (legacy column name)
```

### Query functions (`queries.ts`)

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `getSite(slug)` | Returns the site config and current board state |
| `updateBoard(slug, board)` | Saves board state and rewrites log rows in a single batch |
| `addUndo(board)` | Inserts a board snapshot into `undos`, returns the new row ID |
| `getUndo(id)` | Retrieves a prior board snapshot by ID |
| `clearUndos(slug)` | Deletes undo rows older than 48 hours for a site; called on daily reset |
| `getAccessCode(slug)` | Returns the stored hash and salt for a site |
| `setAccessCode(slug, hash, salt)` | Stores a new hashed access code for a site |
| `updateConfig(slug, config)` | Updates the site config JSON in the database |

---

## Environment variables

Nuxt maps `NUXT_*` env vars to `runtimeConfig` automatically.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `NUXT_TURSO_URL` | Turso database URL |
| `NUXT_TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Turso auth token |
| `NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD` | Cookie encryption key — must be at least 32 characters |
| `NUXT_ADMIN_CODE` | Access code for administrative functions on board |

Generate a session password:
```sh
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Fill in all values in `.env` — it is gitignored.
