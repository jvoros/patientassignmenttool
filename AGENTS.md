# Patient Assignment Tools Guidelines

These are the guidelines for this specific application. The guiedelines should be followed to ensure the project stays in line with our main goals.

## Foundational Content

This application is used to assign patients to doctors and advance-practice providers (APPs) in a hospital emergency department. This is only for the staff on shift to know who is assigned which patient. There is no connection to the medical record. No patient specific data is stored in this application.

The applicaiton is built around a "board." Each site, or Emergency Department, will have one board for each calendar day.

Each site has several key properties:
- access code: a shared password used by staff to access the board
- time zone: which standard time zone the department is in
- rooms: a list of rooms in that department
- providers: all the doctors and APPs that work at that site
- schedules: the various schedules for each day, including start and end times
- zones: the different zones of the department
- board: this is the core of the application and where patients are assigned to providers

### The Board

Each site has a board. The board exists for one calendar day. Each board contains many shifts. Each shift is a combination of a provider and a schedule. Each board contains several zones. Every board includes a zone for "Off Rotation". Each shift can belong to more than one zone.

Some zones are a rotation. A patient is assinged to a shift and the rotation advances so when the next patient arrives, staff know which provider will care for the next patient. 

Some zones are simply a list of providers and nothing rotations.

Some zones are a rotation for patient arrivals as well as a secondary supervisor rotation. Doctors will rotate who is up next to supervise APPs or residents.

Some zones are staffed only with APPs but use the supervisor rotation from another zone.

In the morning, when the first shift of the day is added to the board, the board will 'reset' and clear all the data from the previous day and start with a fresh board.

### Shifts

Some shifts have a 'bonus'. For example, if a shift has a bonus of 2 (2 more patients than usual) when the shift first joins the board, that shift will care for the first three patient arrivals before the rotation advances (1 patient for the usual turn, plus 2 bonus patients for the first turn). The bonus can vary for each schedule item.

### Providers

Some providers are doctors, some are APPs, some are residents. Only some providers can supervise other providers.

### Patients

The only data stored about patients are their mode of arrival (e.g. walk in, ambulance, fast track, police), their arrival time, and their room. Each patient is assigned to a shift. Each shift keeps track of how many patients they have been assigned and how many patients they have supervised.

Some shifts also keep track of how many patients they have 'triaged' but this is a count handled by the provider on their own by clicking a button on the board to log this activity.

### Events

The board keeps track of events that change the state of the board, e.g. when a provider joins the board, when a patient is assigned, when a provider triages a patient, when a provider switches zones, or when a provider logs out.

These events are displayed on the board so staff can see how things are happening.

The most recent event can be undone, reverting the board to the prior state before that event happened. There is no need for a redo action.

### Logs

When the board resets at the beginning of each day, before reset the shift data is saved into the logs table so we can track how many patients each shift sees each day. This is the main extent of the data persistence required in this use case.

## Technical Goals

This app is developed by a single developer in their spare time. Currently using Hono.js and Vue.js requires a lot of boilerplate code to accomplish shared-password authentication, api handling between front and back ends.

Simplicity in code and code that is easy to reason about are the highest priority.

Being able to easily add and change features is more important that collecting and storing every granular detail about a site's activity.

I am open to revisions to this code or rewriting the app using a different technology stack if it will help with the main goals of simplicity and flexibility.

## Current Tech Stack and Architecture

Currently the app is built in typescript and uses a Hono.js server and a Vue.js frontend. This required building an authentication layer, building API endpoints, implementing websockets. We are switching to Laravel to avoid all this boilerplate overhead.

Communication between users and the server is two way, but is not complex. One user takes an action on the board, like assigning a patient to a shift, then the server broadcasts the updated board back to all the users logged in to that site. 

Only one action can occur at a time, enacted by one user.

### JSON State

The current app holds the board state in a single JSON object. Once any action occurs, the current state is saved as a previous state and the board is updated. The 'undo' action simply reverts to the previous state. From that state users can undo again, simply traversing back through previous states.

The modules in the 'core' directory handle the manipulation of the JSON state object.

Here is an example of the current JSON state object:

The new stack should use something similar. Simpler is always better. A different structure is acceptable. 

### Database

The database has these tables:

- sites
- logs
- undos

This is the current structure but could be changed as needed. Modules in the 'database' directory handle communication with the database.

### Sites

Currently each site uses a JSON configuration file. This is cumbersome. Here is an example config file:

```json
const config: SiteConfig = {
  name: "St. Mark's Hospital",
  slug: "smh",
  zones: {
    main: {
      slug: "main",
      name: "Main Rotation",
      type: "dual",
      superZone: "main",
      triggerSkip: false,
    },
    ft: {
      slug: "ft",
      name: "Orange - Fast Track",
      type: "simple",
      superZone: "main",
      triggerSkip: true,
      pitZone: true,
    },
    off: {
      slug: "off",
      name: "Off Rotation",
      type: "list",
      triggerSkip: false,
    },

### Server

The 'server' director contains the hono setup. This is where the app feels the most fragile. Changes here are difficult to debug between front and back end. Custom authentication and websocket handlers are brittle and difficult to change.

### Client

The 'client' director contains the Vue files for the front end. Passing data around the Vue app is painful. Especially since the front end modules aren't doing any real manipulation or rich interactions of the data from the server. PHP or HTMX could likely provide a very similar experience of updating on websocket broadcasts. 

Using Vue on the frontend also meant separate vite configuration to have a working development server and then configuration of the Hono server to handle SPA architecture which is overkill in this case.

## Goals

Simplify the application architecture to make updates and modifications less brittle, more constrained by convention.

Other pain points not mentioned:
- error handling
- adding sites and configurations
- websocket build to handle multiple sites
- front and backend scope confusion
